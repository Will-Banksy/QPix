# QPix

--- WIP ---

A simple little pixel art editor, using the Qt libraries

## Compile And Run

You need Qt5 and CMake 3.1 or higher (I'm using Qt 5.15.2 but it should work on earlier versions)

You will also need a C++20 compliant compiler

### Compile

Navigate to project directory:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
### Run

```bash
./qpix
```
